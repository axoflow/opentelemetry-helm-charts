# AxoSyslog OpenTelemetry Demo Helm Chart - a cloud-native distribution of syslog-ng by Axoflow

This repository contains the OpenTelemetry Demo [chart](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) for [AxoSyslog](https://github.com/axoflow/axosyslog-docker), which is intended to make it convenient to install AxoSyslog's OpenTelemetry demonstration based on [OpenTelemetry Demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo).

You can read more about syslog-ng's and AxoSyslog's OpenTelemetry support in Axoflow's [blog post](https://axoflow.com/axosyslog-opentelemetry/).

## How to use

[Helm](https://helm.sh) must be installed to use the charts.  Please refer to
Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs) to get started.

Once Helm has been set up correctly, add the repo as follows:

    helm repo add axosyslog-opentelemetry-demo https://axoflow.github.io/opentelemetry-helm-charts

If you had already added this repo earlier, run `helm repo update` to retrieve
the latest versions of the packages.  You can then run `helm search repo
axosyslog-opentelemetry-demo` to see the charts.

To install the opentelemetry-demo chart:

    helm install my-axosyslog-opentelemetry-demo axosyslog-opentelemetry-demo/opentelemetry-demo

To uninstall the chart:

    helm delete my-axosyslog-opentelemetry-demo
